<p>
The first abstraction is the <dfn>collection</dfn>,
defined by the predicate <code>coll?</code>.
Collections may be <dfn>associative</dfn>, <dfn>sequential</dfn>,
both, or neither.
Associative colls support key-value lookups.
Maps are the traditional associative data structure,
but vectors can be treated as mappings of indices to values.
Sequential colls retain a linear ordering under insertion and deletion.
Lists and vectors have this property.
Note that a vector is both sequential and associative
while a set is neither.
