<h1>Collections and Sequences in Clojure</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The topic of collections and sequences in Clojure can be quite confusing
for beginners.
In this document I aim to explain how these two abstractions differ 
and how they work together.
</p>

<h2>Collections</h2>

<p>
A <dfn>collection</dfn> may be identified by the predicate <code>coll?</code>.
Collections may be <dfn>associative</dfn>, <dfn>sequential</dfn>,
both, or neither.
Associative colls support key-value lookups.
Maps are the traditional associative data structure,
but vectors can be treated as mappings of indices to values.
Sequential colls retain a linear ordering under insertion and deletion.
Lists and vectors have this property.
Note that a vector is both sequential and associative
while a set is neither.

<p>TODO: sorted-set, hash-set, sorted-map, hash-map</p>

<h2>Sequences</h2>

<p>
A <dfn>sequence</dfn> is a data structure
that is expected to be accessed in a sequential manner.
It may be infinitely long, and may require additional computation
in order to read.
</p>

<h2>Relationship between the two</h2>

<ul>
  <li>All sequences are also collections.</li>
  <li>You can derive a sequence backed by collection.</li>
  <li>You can read any sequence into a new collection.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nota Bene: Sequences are implemented as lists.</p>

<div id="tbl-collseq"></div>

<p>TODO: counted?</p>

<h2>Equality</h2>

<p>TODO: Equality partitions re: seqs and colls</p>

<div id="tbl-eqpart"></div>

<p>TODO: effect of metadata, sortedness</p>

<p>TODO: comparison with other Java Collections</p>
