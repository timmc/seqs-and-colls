<h1>Collections and Sequences in Clojure</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Newcomers to Clojure are often confused by the
<a href="http://clojure.org/data_structures#Data%20Structures-Collections">collection</a> and <a href="http://clojure.org/sequences">sequence</a> abstractions
and how they relate to one another.
This document aims to provide an overview of these concepts
and how they may be used in one's code.
</p>

<h2>Collections</h2>

<p>
Clojure's Collection API provides a generic mechanism for creating and handling
compound data.
Technically, a Clojure <dfn>collection</dfn> is an object claiming the
<code class="class-c.l">clojure.lang.IPersistentCollection</code> interface.
This may be discovered using the predicate <code class="fn-c.core">coll?</code>.
The associated conceptual abstraction is that of a bag o' values,
supporting certain operations:
Adding, removing, counting, finding, and iterating over the values.
Commonly seen examples are lists, maps, vectors, sets, and seqs,
but these are not the only collection types that Clojure provides.
</p>

<p>
Different collection types have different APIs, performance characteristics,
and intended patterns of usage.
Any given collection may match one or more of the following predicates,
which group collection types by their broad characteristics:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><code class="fn-core">counted?</code></dt>
  <dd>These colls know their size and can calculate their <code>count</code>
    in constant time, without actually traversing their data.
    This is not just a performance characteristic â€”
    some collections are infinite or may not be able to predict their size
    without running arbitrary code.</dd>

  <dt><code class="fn-core">associative?</code></dt>
  <dd>Associative colls support key-value lookups.
    Maps are the traditional associative data structure,
    but vectors can be treated as mappings of indices to values.</dd>
  
  <dt><code class="fn-core">sequential?</code></dt>
  <dd>Sequential colls retain a linear ordering under insertion and deletion.
    Lists, seqs, and vectors have this property.
    Note that a vector is both sequential and associative,
    while a set is neither.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Here we see which collections support which predicates,
as well as how some non-collections are treated:</p>

<div id="tbl-colltypes"></div>

<p>Note that the string is not a collection, but may be converted into one.</p>

<p>TODO: Raid clojure.core repo for instances of IPersistentCollection, ISeq, etc.</p>

<h2>Sequences</h2>

<p>
A <dfn>sequence</dfn> is a data structure
that is expected to be accessed in a sequential manner.
It may be infinitely long, and may require additional computation
in order to read.
</p>

<div id="tbl-seq"></div>

<p>TODO: seq API</p>

<div id="tbl-seq-remain"></div>

<h2>Relationship between the two</h2>

<ul>
  <li>All sequences are also collections.</li>
  <li>You can derive a sequence backed by any collection.
      Some collections have more than one seq implementation. (rseq [])
      </li>
  <li>You can read any sequence into a new collection.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nota Bene: Sequences are not implemented as lists,
they just act a lot like them and
are may be backed by similar data structures.</p>

<div id="tbl-collseq"></div>

<p>TODO: counted?</p>

<h2>Equality</h2>

<p>TODO: Equality partitions re: seqs and colls</p>

<div id="tbl-eqpart"></div>

<p>TODO: effect of metadata, sortedness</p>

<p>TODO: comparison with other Java Collections</p>

<h2>Further reading</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Different implementations of colls:
      sorted-set, hash-set, sorted-map, hash-map, array-map</li>
  <li>Polymorphism under the collection and sequence APIs
      (e.g. invisible shifts in implementation as you hammer on a coll.)</li>
  <li>Performance characteristics.</li>
</ul>
