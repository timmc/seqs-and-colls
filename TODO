* Hella more text
* Better icons for results (true/false/exception)
  - Check/X connotes works/error.
  - Get away from good/bad iconography? Maybe 0 and 1 (on/off symbols)
  - Bomb icon for exceptions
  - Thumbs up/down?
* Link functions in text, table to ClojureDocs
* Show actual error/value for each result (title text?)
